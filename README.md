# **MachineLearning Model Application**
By Rodrigo Guarneros

**Would you survive the titanic?**

Based on profiles of survivors such as: Ticket class, sex, age, and more. I build a machine learning model to classify and determine the probability of being a survivor.

Funny excercise to create a model based on the titanic data and predict if you or someone else will be a survivor
